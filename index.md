# GENUARY 2022

GENUARY is back! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It happens during the month of January 2022, and everybody is invited!

For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt to base your code art on.

You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y'know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium, on any planet.

Share your work and tag it with **#genuary** and **#genuary2022**.

# [PROMPTS](prompts)

Click for the [prompts](prompts) for each day. These are the actual prompts, but you're only supposed to do them on that particular day. Though if you decided to cheat and implement all these prompts before the start of January 2022, that would actually be pretty impressive. Share them too!

# TIPS & TRICKS

* Prepare a nice framework for yourself before January to quickly be able to start trying out ideas.
* Don't get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and creative. If you start to resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively, then ramp down your goals (and time spent) to just what you want to get out of this. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom? Getting ideas? It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've got this.
* There's a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it's convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.
